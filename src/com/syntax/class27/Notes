Abstract:
is a process of hidding implemantation deatails and showing functionallity only
abstract clases are classes that are declared with abstract keyword they help us achive abstraction
abstraction help us divied the workload and multiple child classes and helps us reduce complexity of code

Rules:
1)use abstract keyword to define a abstract class
2)we can have an abstract class with or without abstract methods
3)we must delcare a class as an abstract class even if we have a single abstract method inside it
4)we can not create the obj of an abstract class directly but we can extend this class and can create the obj of child
classes that way we will be able to use fields and methods from abstract class.
5)we cannot declare a class as final and abstract because it contradicts each other (final means no extension and
abstract means incomplete and some classes should extend it and complete it)
6)we can have public private, protected, members in abstract class but in interface always all the fields are public static final
7)we can not have a method as static and abstract because can't override
8)we can not have a method as private and abstract because private members don't participate in inheritance and we will
never be able to implement that method.
9)we can not have a method as final and abstract

=================================================================
Interface in java
Interface in java are also used to achive abstraction
Rules:
1) All the fields in an interface are by default public static final
2) All the methods in an interface are public and abstract by defult

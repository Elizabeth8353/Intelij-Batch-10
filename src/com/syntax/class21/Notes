"this" keyword:
We can use this keyword to defferentiate between local and instant variables.

class car{
String make;
String model;

car(String make, String model){
this.make=make;  if we dont have this. java will give prefence to local var and will not initialize our instance
this.model=model;
}
void park(){
String make;
syso("car"+make(local var)+this.make(instant var);

"this()"
we can use this() to refer to the constructors of the class
if we have multiple constructor java will deciede based on the parameters
which constructor to call
this keyword to call the methods
===============================================
Inheritace:
is a mechanisim in java through which we can acess all the fields and methods
from one code to another class

We use extends keyword to inherit the properties and methods
Advantages:
we can avoid code duplications
it reduces amount of code

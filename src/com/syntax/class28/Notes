Recap:
Abstraction:
Process of hidden implementation details and showing only the functunality to the user is called abstract in java:
We can achieve abstraction in java using abstraction in java using abstract classes and interfaces
Abstract:
Abstract classes are classes with abstract keyword
1)we can have define and undefine methods in abstract classes.
2)we can not create the object of abstract classes directly, but we can create it indirectly with help of inheritance
==========================================================================================
Interface:
-are contracts in java all the classes which implement an interface must provide the implementation for the abstract
methods in that interface.
-interfaces don't acts like classes, they support multiple inheritance, they don't contain constructor ,
their data entity didn't accept access modifiers
-interfaces do not have constructors
Interface Properties:
all the variables are public, static, final
all methods are public and abstract by default

(abstract,static,final)NON ACCESS MODIFIERS
(public, private and protected)abstract modifiers
=========================================================================================
Encapsulation
-its hidden the fields of a class by making them private and prviding the getters and setters to read and write
those fields
-benefits is that it provides security by writting different validation steps before values are assigned to the fields
of a class.We can also write logic to provide restricted access to these fields

=========================================================================================
Problem with primitive variables
-they can only hold a single value at a time
int a=10;
we can solve this problem with the help of arrays
Arrays can hold multiple values in a single variable

Issues with arrays
-fixed in size

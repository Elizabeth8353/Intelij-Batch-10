Constructors:
Special Block of code that help us build/ initialize(gives initial value to our fields) our objects. when we write new
className(); the code inside no argument the constructor is executed

when we do not provide a constructor a default no argument constructor is provided by compiler.
if we have multiple constructor java will check the number of arguments and type of arguments and type of arguments to
decide which constructor to execute.

= when using assignment operator we are assigning a value of the same type

constructor does not have a return type because once an obj is created the constructor is already returning the
memory referece of our class to that obj so thats why we don't need that return type

if we have same number of patamenters for our construction and same datatype and sequence java
will give and error the sequence needs to be different or number of data types or or datatypes

We  can use a method to initialize our code but constructor makes it look cleaner
we can call it in one line of code

This()
this keyword when used with parenthesis calls the constuctor of a class which
constructor to call is decieded based on the data type of arguments that we are passing
It helps us reduce duplicate code as n real life projects we might be writing a lot of constructors

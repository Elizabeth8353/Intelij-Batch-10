Types of Variables in Java:
There  are 3 types of variables in java
1) local Variable
2) Static Varible
3) instant Variable

Local Variable :
Are those variables which are declared inside a block of code (Method, loop, constructor)
When to use:
Try to always use it because it dosent ocupy memeory for shotest period of time in all the variables
as soon as block of code is executed memory is free and can be used by other programs. we cannot use static keyword
with local variables
2)Instant variables:
those variables which are outside of block of code but inside a class without static keywords are called instant variables

when to use:
when we know that from object to object we will be having different values and we might
alse need to share the varibles between difference instant methods of that class
3)static variables:
Those instance variables that have static keyword with them are called static varibles.
one single copy of variables  is shared accross all the objects
WHen to use:
when we need to share something with all the objects
they are mostly used as constants

We can also have instance and static methods but we cannot use instance variables or methods
derectly inside a static method if we want to use them we must create ann obje

==============================================================
Access modification is done in java with the help of three keywords
1.private
2.protected
3.public
4.is not actually if we dont use any keyword with fields/methods default
access is given to that field /method
1)private
private is most restricted one we can only

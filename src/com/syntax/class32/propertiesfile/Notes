If you have to read the data use FileInputStream
If you have to write the date use FileOutPutStream
If you have to open the file use properties.load()
If you have to store/write data into that file use properties.store()


If you want to open an existing file and you want to make changes and want to store that file read/write data.
We use FileInput and FIleOutput  and properties.load() and properties.store()

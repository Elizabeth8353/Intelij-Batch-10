Access Modifiers:
Keywords that determine the acceess of members (fiels/methods/constructors)
There are four access level and 3 access modifiers keywords
1.private
2.default(not a keyword)
3.protected
4.public

Private:
if we use private keyword with fields or methods those fields and methods only accessible within same class

Default:
default is not a keyword if we don't specify any keyword with the fields/methods default access is automatically applied
to java that means that field or method is accesible within same class and package

Protected:
if we use the protected keyword that field/method is accesible within same class and same package outside of package but
we have to write "extends" keyword and only can access it without creating an obj of that class

Public:
accessable through out project with or without creating an object of that class
===================================================================================
Class Constructors and this keyword
Constructors is similar to methods may or may not return something but constructor always never return anything not
even void
1)we use constructor to give initial values to fields of class
2)constructors always have same name as class while methods can have any name

we can have multiple constructors to ease the creation of obj
when we have multiple constructors java decides based on the type and number of arguments that
we are passing when we are creating an object if we are passing three
values java will

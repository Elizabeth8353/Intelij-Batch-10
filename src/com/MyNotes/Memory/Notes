with the help of new keyword we are able to create an obj
which is stored in our heap area all objs are stored in our heap area
all fields will have memory addreses.

our variables are stored in our stack area
all variable type obj the address from our heap is assigned to that variable

for primitive the value for that variable is directly stored in that stack memory they are not stored in heap
since primitive they directly contain the values in stack area they do not have that indirection
they don't have memory addresses only obj variables can contain memory addresses from our heap

we cannot called methods in a null since null has no value or memory since variable with null value is pointing to nothing
methods cannot be called on a variable that don't point to anything or don't hold value

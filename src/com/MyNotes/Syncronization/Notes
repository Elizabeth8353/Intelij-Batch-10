What is thread safe?
also called syncronization
what is syncronize?


multithreaded concept?
we provide multiple thread for the operation,multiple processors are going on at one time,in order to save time in processing
in multithreading concept we are handling multithreading processors at one time, security is the main concern in that case we need one concept
called threat safety. Thread safety refers to the code which we write in java language can easily be shared among the processes which are
going on at one point in time if we are doing all these things it means we are insuring the threat safety and if we are ensuring the thread safety
and if we are ensuring the thread safety we can say its synchronized or with the process or thread safe. Handling multiple processes at one time
multithreading

Hashmap = is not thread safe not synchronized no maintenance or order insertion it executes without maintaining the order it does
not search the data it doesn't store the data in order
 hashtable= similar to hash table but its synchronized

 HashTable= is synchronized and thread safe

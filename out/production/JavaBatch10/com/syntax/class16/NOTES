Types of Variables in java:
-local- exist in inside the method only
-Instant- exist inside class in or out of method boarder scope Not is Static methods
-Static= like local but with static word also known as class variables

**when click on shift twice = shift+shift it will look for anything increase size etc.
Instant =variables declared outside of a method,loop, constructor, or a block of code but insure a
class without static keyword are called instant variables
we call them instant variables because for each obj of a class a new copy of the variables is crated in the memory
when use:
when a value is expected to change from obj to obj we should declare an instant variable for those

Static variables: can access none static methods too
instance variables with a static keyword are called static variables. They are called class level variables
because their value stay same accross all the obj and only one memory allocation is occupied from the main memory
when use:
when we have to share something across all obj or if something is same for all obj we should store info in static var
mostly they are used as constants, As good practice acess them using class name

local variables:
Variables which are declared inside a method or loop or switch or any block of code are called local variables
local variables occupy the memory in computer for shortest period of time

Static methods:
we can have static methods as well but static methods

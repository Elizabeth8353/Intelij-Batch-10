Method Overloading in Java:
Method overloading is when we have same name of method inside a class but with different type, number or sequence of parameters
but with different type number or sequence of parameters
We overload method t reuse code and write cleaner code

Method overload rules:
1. To overload we must have at least two methods with same name inside a class
2. we cannot overload a method by just changing the return type
3. we ca not overload by just changing the access modifier
4. static methods can also be overloaded
5. We can also overload the constructor of a class
6. if different return type don't matter

Var Args
is a mechanisim in java through which we can handle arrays and multi arguments of same type in a method parameter
we can treat the Var args same as an array inside the method

Void array(String...name){
sout name[0];
sout names.length;
for(int i=0;i<names.length;i++){
sout names[i]
}
}
Interview question:
can main method be overloaded

with out inheritance overriding is not possible
if you want to override paramenters must

method signature= method name and parameters and return type
private does not participate in inheritance
constructor do not participate in inheritance

Super Keyword:
Super Keyword is only applicable when we have at least two classes that have parent child relationship
if we have duplicate field/method in parent and child class we can use superkey word to refer to the parent class
field/method and if we do not use super keyword field /method from child class will be referred.
we can also use super keyword with parentheses to call the parent class constructor so that we do not repeat that
code in all the child classes

Map
is an interface that helps us store the data in form of key value pairs.

Map is a data structure (it is a way to store and manipulate data ) that stores keys and values cannot be dupplicate

keys and values in the form pair

keys and values must be object
keys cannot be dupplicate or will override
values can be duplicate

when to use map:
when fast search is required because of underlying data structure
when we want the index other then natural indexes like integers

Type of maps
Hashmap- order is not mantained. But it is fastest. It is not thread safe
LinkHashmap- order is mantained but it is slowere than hashmap
TreeMap-it always stores the data in the sorted form thats why it is slower
HashTable- it is similar to the hashmap it should be used when we have to write the code of multithreading because
it is thread safe but it is slower than hashmap

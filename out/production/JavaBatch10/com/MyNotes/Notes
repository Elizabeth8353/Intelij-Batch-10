super keyword in java is used to invoke imidiate parent class constructor, refer imidiate parent class instance
variables, invoke immidiate parent class methods

super keyword is used to access hidden super class variables in subclass
super is used to refer to parent class obj

this() and super() cannot use both in a constructor because both this and super should be the first statement

"this" is used to refer the current obj of a class in java

cannot have this() in methods compile time error only inside constructors

Why we use variables= to get something processed by our processors inside our computers we first need to store that thing inside main
memory the ram once its loaded in main memory the processor can start executing it and show us output for this purpose we use variables
*we use variables to hold single values, hold our data,consists of datatype and identifier(name of variable) and value. can make variables
of primitive and non primitive types. variables limitations only can hold one value at a time if we try to change it will be overridden

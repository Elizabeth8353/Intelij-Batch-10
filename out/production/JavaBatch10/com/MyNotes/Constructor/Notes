Constructor:
Special block of code thats executed when we create an obj of a class
its used to initialize our instant fields/property
**Constructors are not inherited, By using superKeyword we can call super class constructor from sub class constructor
**Constructors are not overriden since they are not inherited
Rules:
-need to have same name of class
-we can use access modifiers public,protected, default and private
-most of the times constructors will be public
-if default access modifier only can create obj in that package
-NO return type with constructors because they are used to initialize
and while the JVM is creating the obj when we use the new keyword with call of constructor
jvm underhood is allocating the memory on computer and initializing our fields
and returning and obj which is stored inside our variable that obj is nothing but a memory address

**the order of execution of constructor through inheritance is from Base to derived class
